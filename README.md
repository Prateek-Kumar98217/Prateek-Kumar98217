Hi, I’m Prateek — a Computer Science undergrad with a solid foundation in Machine Learning and NLP.

Over time, I’ve grown most comfortable on the backend — building with Django, Flask, and now FastAPI — where clean logic, APIs, and scalable systems feel like home.

I’m actively exploring how to take ML and NLP further through Agentic AI — systems that not only understand language, but can act, reason, and adapt in real-world scenarios.

Right now, I’m focused on:
– Building and deploying backend + AI-driven apps
– Designing practical NLP pipelines
– Prototyping intelligent, autonomous agents

Always open to share, learn, and collaborate on meaningful AI projects.
Let’s connect and build something worthwhile.
