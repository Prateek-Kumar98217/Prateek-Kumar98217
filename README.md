Hi, I’m @Prateek-Kumar98217
I am a Computer Science and Engineering student with a strong passion for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Currently, I am focusing on learning and applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) to explore how machines can understand, interpret, and generate human language. This area excites me as I work to solve real-world challenges by building AI-driven solutions.

Additionally, I am delving into Agentic AI, where I combine my critical thinking and problem-solving skills to design intelligent systems that can take autonomous actions and make decisions. My goal is to deepen my understanding of how intelligent agents can be built to address complex, dynamic problems.

As I continue my studies and project work, I am excited to apply these concepts to create innovative solutions that push the boundaries of AI, while developing my skills in this rapidly evolving field. I’m always eager to collaborate with others who share my passion and to contribute to impactful AI-driven projects.
